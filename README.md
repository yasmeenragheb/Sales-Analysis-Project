# Sales-Analysis-Project
This project is based on a case study I completed during a technical assessment as part of a job application process. The task involved analyzing sales data for a company operating in the tech product sector. The goal was to extract insights that would support data-driven decision-making for the sales department.

The sales department of a company that specializes in tech products required an in-depth analysis of their sales data. The objective was to help the sales team identify product trends and better understand customer behavior. By exploring sales patterns and customer interactions, the analysis aimed to support more informed and strategic decisions.
